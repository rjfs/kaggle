After doing some data distribution analysis on train and test sets, I concluded that train set had to be augmented in order to better look like test set. After this change, some features were generated, like:
- Lag features (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 12 months)
- Prices features (Price of item relative to other shops, min/max price of item, etc)
- Target mean encoded features (item in given shop, item in given city, category in given city, etc.)
- Date features (month, number of days in month, number of weekend days in month)
- Features interactions (Difference between number of items sold in last month and two months ago)
Not all the features ended up being used.

Different models were implemented but the best ones were:
- LightGBM with GBDT boosting type
- LightGBM with Dart boosting type

Then, a L2 Regularized Linear Regression is applied to generate an ensemble.

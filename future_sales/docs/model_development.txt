After doing some data distribution analysis on train and test sets, I concluded that train set had to be augmented in order to better look like test set. After this change, some features were generated, like:
- Lag features (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 12 months)
- Prices features (Price of item relative to other shops, min/max price of item, etc)
- Date features (month, number of days in month, number of weekend days in month)
- Features interactions (Difference between number of items sold in last month and two months ago)
Not all the features ended up being used.

After generating and parsing features, two models are applied:
- L1 Regularized Linear Regression (sklearn Lasso)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (xgboost XGBRegressor)

Then, a L2 Regularized Linear Regression is applied to generate an ensemble.
